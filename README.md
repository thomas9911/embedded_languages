# Embedded languages

A list of scripting languages that can be embedded in a rust application

## Scripting languages

### Lua

The OG embeddable language. Implemented here with `mlua` with the `luau` or
roblox lua syntax.

### Javascript

Implemented using `Deno`, which uses v8 under the hood

**Maybe look into quickjs**

### Python

Not exactly python but close, `Starlark`
